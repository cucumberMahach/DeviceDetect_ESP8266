# Device Detect (ESP8266, NodeMCU)
Detect device in WiFi network using ESP8266

When the ESP8266 detects the device, the built-in LED on the board (NodeMCU) lights up. When the device is disconnected from the network, the LED goes out.

## Before compile and run
1. At the beginning of the file, you need to change the network settings and the device address to your own.
2. The code uses the built-in LED on the NodeMCU board.
